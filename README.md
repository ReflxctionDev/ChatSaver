# ChatSaver
A Minecraft mod which saves chats when switching worlds

## Usage
When you first switch worlds, Minecraft would close your chat box and clear its content. What this mod does is save the content of the last thing that was typed in your chat box. When you switch worlds, you will have to press a button (which can be specified and found in the controls menu, default: **U**), this button would open a chat box with your last content. To clear the saved content you had, you press another key which is also specified in the controls menu (default: **Y**), your last content was cleared from the saver integrated in the mod.

## Commands
Command: /chatsaver, alias: /cs
* /cs toggle - Toggles the mod
* /cs notifications - Toggles the notifications sent when you do an action (e.g clear chat, open the saved content, etc.)
